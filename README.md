# Collision-Simulator-In-Python
Simulating motion of atoms in a medium on randomly changing the temperature

## Installation
* Install [SimpleGui](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplegui) -python graphics library.
* Clone the repo
* `cd Collision-Simulator-in-Python && python collison.py`

## Online Playground
* Can also be executed on [codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#tabs-Python)
* Copy the code [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org) and run. 

## Working 
On running a specified size window frame appears and user is prompted with required questions. Then user can view the motion and change the temperature of the medium by hitting 'h' key to heat and 'c' key to cool. Mouseclick would change the reference ball to change the view perspective. 

## Notes
It is just a rough model with more improvement hence any ideas and implementations are most welcome!!
