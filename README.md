# Collision-Simulator-In-Python
Simulating motion of atoms in a medium on randomly changing the temperature

<h3> Getting Started </h3>
<h4> Installation <h4>
<ol>
   <li> Install <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplegui">SimpleGui</a>-python graphics library, clone the repo and execute on python interpreter</li>
   <li> Can also be executed on <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#tabs-Python">codeskulptor</a> - Copy the code <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/">here<a> and run  
</ol>

<h3> Working </h3>
<ul> 
  <li> On running a specified size window frame appears and user is prompted with required questions</li>
  <li> Then user can view the motion and change the temperature of the medium by hitting 'h' key to heat and 'c' key to cool</li>
  <li> Mouseclick would change the reference ball to change the view perspective</li>
<ul>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
It is just a rough model with more improvement hence any ideas and implementations are mose welcome!!
